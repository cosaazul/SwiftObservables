// Purpose: Property wrapper that adds did/will set connectivity to Observers


/// Declare this wrapper on any property using `@Observable` to access
/// the Observer system w/o involving NSObject/Obj-C KPO.  It adds code
/// to manage `Observation` arrays, and provide didSet/willSet-like triggers.
