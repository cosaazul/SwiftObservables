// Purpose: An object that mediates observation settings between an Observable and an observer.


/// Use this to specify the callback type an Observation represents
public enum ObservationType { case disabled, all, did, will }


/// An `Observation` indicates how an `Observable` should invoke the closure
/// registered on it through the `observe()` API, which creates and returns
/// the object.  The observation describes the closure via the `ObservationType`,
/// indicating if it is a willSet or didSet observation, both, or inactive.
///
/// An Observation is stored in a simple array by the observable associated
/// with it and communicates the intention of the observer that created it.
/// The observer can set its type just once, or it can store the Observation,
/// allowing it to communicate changes to the observable holding it.
///
/// An observation can be placed in a permanent `.disabled` state by setting
/// `isObsolete` to `true`, after which it cannot  be set back to `false`.
/// Besides guaranteeing the associated closure is never again called, this state
/// also signals certain code areas to release the observation and its closure.
/// Binding uses this mechanism to release its co-binding observation when one
/// side of the relationship goes out of scope.
